# Deku
---

Deku is a [DGraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph) query builder ðŸ¦¸ </br>
Compose fluently complex and dynamic DGraph queries & mutation!

---

### Status
The project is currently **ðŸ¦¸ In super early stages ðŸ¦¸**, the API hasn't stabilised just yet.
Many features are still under development.

### Why?
The DGraph query language is awesome! it is really powerful, and you can achieve a lot with it.
However, as you start trying to add dynamicity (like any other declarative query language) you soon starts
fiddling with a lot strings concatenations and can quickly get messy.

Deku tries to simplify the construction of DGraph Queries and mutations with a fluent API.
